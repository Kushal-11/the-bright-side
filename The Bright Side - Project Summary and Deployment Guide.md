## Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+ and pnpm
- Python 3.11+ with pip
- Environment variables for OPENAI_API_KEY and OPENAI_API_BASE

### Frontend Deployment
1. Build the React application:
   ```bash
   cd the-bright-side
   pnpm run build
   ```

2. Copy build files to Flask static directory:
   ```bash
   cp -r dist/* ../bright-side-api/src/static/
   ```

### Backend Deployment
1. Activate virtual environment:
   ```bash
   cd bright-side-api
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set environment variables:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_together_ai_key"
   export OPENAI_API_BASE="https://api.together.xyz/v1"
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

### Production Deployment Options
- **Service Deployment**: Use `service_deploy_backend` for permanent hosting
- **Port Exposure**: Use `service_expose_port` for temporary access
- **Environment**: Ensure all dependencies are in requirements.txt
